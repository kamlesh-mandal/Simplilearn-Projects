# myPortfolio: Easy Way to Create Your Amazing Portfolio.
DESCRIPTION

# Project Objective: 

As a Full Stack Developer, you have to create a frontend for the myPortfolio application. 

 

# Background of the problem statement: 

In the third sprint, the scrum team agreed to develop the frontend of the application using an Angular framework. Since you were recently trained in working on this framework, you’re chosen to lead this project and complete the initial part of the application. You agree to complete this task as early as possible, as the release of the application is next week. 

 

You must use the following: 

● Angular: To develop a front-end application that includes a sign up page, a sign in page, and a landing page 
● Git: To connect and push files from the local system to GitHub 
● GitHub: To store the Angular application

 

Following requirements should be met: 

● A few of the source code should be tracked on GitHub repositories. You need to document the tracked files that are ignored during the final push to the GitHub repository.
● The submission of your GitHub repository link is mandatory. In order to track your task, you need to share the link of the repository in the document.
● The step-by-step process involved in completing this task should be documented.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests
